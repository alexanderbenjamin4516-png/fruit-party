# 🍉 Fruit Party!

A Fruit Ninja–style browser game for little kids. Fruit floats up slowly, you slice it by
**waving your hand at the camera** (or just touching the screen). No bombs, no lives, no
game over — a 2-year-old waves and fruit explodes. Big celebration every 10 fruits.

Everything is one file: [index.html](index.html). No build step, no install, no server code.

---

## Put it online (GitHub Pages — free, ~5 minutes)

The camera **requires HTTPS**, which GitHub Pages gives you automatically.

1. Go to <https://github.com/new>. Repository name: `fruit-party`. Keep it **Public**. Click **Create repository**.
2. On the new repo page, click **uploading an existing file**, drag `index.html` in, click **Commit changes**.
   *(Or from this folder: `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURNAME/fruit-party.git && git push -u origin main`)*
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages** (left sidebar). Under **Branch** pick `main`, folder `/ (root)`, click **Save**.
4. Wait 1–2 minutes. Your game is at:
   **`https://YOURNAME.github.io/fruit-party/`**

Any other static host (Netlify Drop, Cloudflare Pages, Vercel) works the same — drop the
file in, get an HTTPS URL.

## Open it on the iPad

1. Open **Safari** and go to your `https://...github.io/fruit-party/` URL.
2. Tap **📷 Start (with camera)** → tap **Allow** when Safari asks for the camera.
3. Wave! (Optional: Share button → **Add to Home Screen** makes a full-screen app icon.)

First load needs internet (the hand-tracking model, ~8 MB, comes from a CDN — it's cached
after that). Sound starts after the first tap — that's an iOS rule, the Start button counts.

### The colored pill (bottom-left) tells you what the camera sees

| Pill | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **✋ I see your hand!** | Tracking is working — a glowing dot follows your fingertip. |
| 🟡 **👋 Show me your hand** | Tracking is fine, but your hand isn't in the picture. Usually it's resting on the mouse/table, below the camera's view. Step back or lift your hand. |
| ⚪ **👆 Touch mode** | Hand tracking is off (couldn't load, or this device is too slow) — touching the screen always works. |

If no hand is seen for a while, the game says it outright: *"Step back so the
camera can see your hand!"*

### If something is off

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Pill stays yellow | Your hand is out of frame — camera probably sees only your head and shoulders. Step back, or angle the camera down, then wave at chest height. |
| Camera prompt never appears / always denied | iPad **Settings → Apps → Safari → Camera → Ask/Allow**, then reload. Or in Safari tap **aA → Website Settings → Camera → Allow**. |
| "Camera needs a secure (https) page" | You opened it via `http://` or a file. Use the GitHub Pages `https://` URL. |
| No sound | Tap the screen once (any tap restarts the audio engine) and check the volume. The ringer/silent switch does **not** mute the game after the first tap — like a real game, it claims the speaker (which may pause background music). ⚙️ shows a live "Audio engine: …" line so you can see what it's doing. |
| Hands feel laggy | The game lowers its own tracking rate first, then rebuilds the tracker in a compatible mode, and only then switches to touch — the pill always shows where it landed. |

## Desktop

Chrome, Safari, or Edge — same URL. Mouse slices just by moving (no clicking needed).
For local development: `python3 -m http.server 8000` in this folder, then
<http://localhost:8000> (`localhost` is allowed to use the camera without HTTPS).

## Playing together on a video call (optional)

Tap **⚙️ → Play together**: both devices enter a nickname and the **same room code**, tap
**Join room**. Each player's name and live score appears top-left on both screens.

How it works, honestly: scores travel through a **free public MQTT relay**
(broker.emqx.io, with two fallbacks) over secure WebSockets — no account and no server,
but it's shared public infrastructure:

- Only the room code, nickname, and score are ever sent. Use first names or nicknames.
- Pick a **unique silly code** (`BANANA-MOON-42`), since anyone using the same code lands
  in the same room.
- If the relay is down, the game says so and plays on solo — multiplayer can never break
  the game. If the relay quietly drops the connection mid-game, the room rebuilds it by
  itself within a few seconds.
- To remove the feature entirely, set `ROOM_ENABLED = false` near the bottom of
  [index.html](index.html).

## Playing Versus mode (take turns, best of 3)

Made for a parent on one device and a kid (with a helper) on the other:

1. Both devices join the **same room code** (see above).
2. On **one** device, open ⚙️ and tap **⚔️ Versus — take turns!**. That's the last
   button anyone needs to press.
3. From here it runs itself: the device that tapped goes first — big **"YOUR TURN!"**,
   a 3-2-1 countdown, then 30 seconds of slicing while a time bar shrinks across the top.
   The other device watches that player's name and score climb in giant letters.
4. Turns flip automatically. A round = one turn each; whoever slices more gets a ⭐
   (a tie gives one to each). Three rounds, most stars wins, and **both** screens get a
   confetti party — the other player sees a "Great game!" message, never a "you lost."
5. If someone's device drops out mid-round, the other screen shows
   *"💤 Waiting for …"* — the round restarts when they return, and after a minute the
   game gives up gracefully and goes back to free play.

Notes: kids never need to tap anything once the room is joined. If a third device is in
the room, the match pairs the tapper with the first other player; everyone else watches.

## Settings

⚙️ gear → one slider: **fruit speed** (🐢…🐇), saved on the device. Default is toddler-slow.

## How the code works (quick tour)

All in [index.html](index.html), top to bottom:

- **Sounds** — synthesized with WebAudio (no audio files): pop = pitch-drop square wave +
  filtered noise burst; quick combos pitch up; cheer = little arpeggio.
- **Fruit** — emoji drawn on a canvas (≥120 px). Each fruit picks where its arc should
  peak and how long it should take, and launch speed/gravity are derived from that, so
  the speed slider scales everything consistently.
- **Slicing / collision** — every input (each finger, mouse, each tracked hand) keeps a
  ~0.3 s trail of points. A fruit pops when the **segment between the last two points**
  passes within its radius (so fast swipes can't tunnel through), *or* when the newest
  point rests inside it (so a toddler holding a finger still pops fruit drifting by).
- **Hand tracking** — MediaPipe HandLandmarker (tasks-vision, pinned CDN version) watches
  the 640×480 selfie video and reports 21 landmarks per hand; we use #8, the index
  fingertip. Detection runs at ~15 Hz, and the blade glides toward the newest fingertip
  every frame, so the trail stays smooth between detections. Coordinates are mapped
  through the same object-fit:cover math the video uses, with X flipped for mirroring.
  A glowing dot marks every detected fingertip, and the status pill reports live whether
  a hand is currently seen.
- **Fallback ladder** — camera denied → gradient background + touch; load fails → one
  retry after 5 s; a detection exception retries 3× then rebuilds the tracker on the CPU
  delegate before giving up; detection averaging too slow → halves its rate, then
  rebuilds on CPU, then touch. Every step is visible in the pill — nothing fails
  silently, and touch/mouse slicing is always on.
- **Versus mode** — one retained ~200-byte JSON state on the room's `_versus` topic.
  Each device is authoritative only while it acts (its own countdown and turn), so no
  clock sync is needed and a second of relay lag is harmless; sequence numbers drop
  stale states, and presence staleness drives the "waiting for…" recovery.
- **Auto quality** — if fps sags, the canvas renders at a lower resolution and the fruit
  cap drops before anything else suffers.

## Milestone test log

Tested in a desktop browser preview (Chromium). **Not yet run on a physical iPad — do the
2-minute checklist below before game time.**

- **M1 touch game**: synthetic swipe slices fruit (score increments); resting-point slice
  works; celebration banner at every 10; speed slider updates + persists; portrait resize
  correct; no console errors.
- **M2 hand tracking**: permission-denial path shows friendly message and keeps playing;
  with a fake camera stream MediaPipe loads from CDN, reaches "wave your hand" state, and
  stays healthy; coordinate mapping verified (camera center → screen center, mirror
  correct); under artificially slow software-GL the perf guard correctly self-disabled to
  touch. Real-hand-in-real-camera verified only by the math + pipeline, not a human hand.
- **M3 polish**: praise banner text, spawn boop, particle cap under rapid slicing.
- **M4 room**: joined a real public relay from the preview; second client appeared on the
  board with name + score; peer received local score updates; leave cleared everything;
  failure path falls back to a friendly message by construction.

### Update 2 (hand feedback + Versus) test log

- **Hand-motion slicing**: a synthetic fingertip sweep was fed through the *real*
  detection pipeline (camera-coordinate mapping → smoothing → trail → collision) at the
  real 15 Hz cadence and sliced a fruit parked mid-screen. Marker and green/yellow pill
  transitions observed live; the 10-second "step back" hint fired.
- **Recoverable failures**: two transient detection exceptions were absorbed (tracking
  survived); a permanent failure disabled tracking *with* the pill flipping to Touch
  mode while the game played on; the slow-GPU path live-rebuilt the tracker on the CPU
  delegate and came back green.
- **Versus, against the real public relay** with a protocol-correct simulated second
  player: full best-of-3 (16/13/14 vs 20/2/20 → 1:2), giant live watcher score,
  zero-click auto-advancing turns, mid-round disconnect → "Waiting for Emma…" →
  reconnect → round restarted → match completed; the one-minute friendly cancel; kind
  loser banner; both sides exited cleanly with the retained match state cleared.
- Found and fixed in the process: a public relay can kick a client with a *clean*
  disconnect, which silently stops mqtt.js auto-reconnect — the room heartbeat now
  detects a dead client and rebuilds the connection.

### Known issues / honest caveats

- **Physical-iPad smoke test pending** (needs a real device): camera permission flow,
  actual hand-tracking fps, audio after first tap. Checklist: load URL → Start with
  camera → Allow → wave → green pill + glowing dot → fruit pops → tap ⚙️ → slider moves.
- Hand identity can swap when two hands cross — a trail may briefly jump. Cosmetic.
- Very old iPads (pre-2017, no decent WebGL) will land in touch mode by design.
- Public MQTT relays carry no uptime promise; the room may occasionally be unavailable.
- Versus turn timing is driven by each device while it plays; if a device sleeps
  mid-turn (auto-lock), the other side sees "waiting" until it wakes. Keep auto-lock off
  or screens awake during a match.
- The score resets on reload — by design, it just counts up forever within a session.
